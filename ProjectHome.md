This is incredibly easy to use, documentation coming soon.

You must edit $load in app/in.php and the config file at app/cf.php in order to get some results.

Your form actions will be in the app/do.php file.  Submit forms using hidden inputs like so, 

&lt;input type="hidden" name="do" value="desired-action" /&gt;
